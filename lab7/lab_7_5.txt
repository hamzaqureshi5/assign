i. Effect of Executing this Program
When this program is executed, it:
This program copies the contents of lab3.txt to lab4.txt. by following steps

1. Opens an existing file named lab3.txt for reading.
2. Creates or opens a file named lab4.txt for reading and writing. If lab4.txt already exists, it truncates it to zero length.
3. Reads data from lab3.txt in chunks of 64 bytes.
4. Writes the read data into lab4.txt.
5. Continues reading and writing until the end of the lab3.txt file is reached.

ii. How End of File is Detected by Program
The end of the file is detected by the read function. When read reaches the end of the file, it returns 0. This is checked in the program with the condition:

if (in_bytes == 0) break;

iii. Arguments Used in the First Call to open

O_RDONLY: A flag indicating that the file is to be opened for reading only.

iv. Arguments Used in Second Call to open
out_fd = open("lab4.txt", O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR);

O_RDWR: A flag indicating that the file is to be opened for reading and writing.
O_CREAT: A flag indicating that the file should be created if it does not already exist.
O_TRUNC: A flag indicating that the file should be truncated to zero length if it already exists.
S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR: File permissions indicating that the owner of the file should have read and write permissions.
