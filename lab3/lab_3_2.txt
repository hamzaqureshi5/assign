1: Define a variable x with value 10 and print it on the screen with the variable name and value

x=10
echo "x = $x"



Step 2: Define a variable xn with value Ali and print it with the variable name and value

xn="Ali"
echo "xn = $xn"


Step 3: Define two variables x=20 and y=5, then print the multiplication result with the expression

x=20
y=5
result=$((x * y))

echo "X = $x"
echo "Y = $y"
echo "\$X * \$Y = $result"
echo "$x * $y = $result"


Step 4: Modify the above to store the division of x and y into a variable called z

x=20
y=5
result=$((x * y))
z=$((x / y))

echo "X = $x"
echo "Y = $y"
echo "\$X * \$Y = $result"
echo "$x * $y = $result"
echo "z = \$X / \$Y = $z"
echo "$x / $y = $z"
